# Airbnb-Dataset-EDA-process
This repository focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for an Airbnb dataset that provides detailed information on listings, hosts, locations, prices, reviews, and other key attributes. The dataset is designed to uncover trends, insights, and patterns that can enhance decision-making for both hosts and travelers.

# Dataset Description
The Airbnb dataset includes the following key columns:

  1) id, name: Unique identifier and name of the listing.
  2) host_id, host_name: Host details.
  3) neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood: Location-based attributes, including broader groups and specific neighborhoods.
  4) latitude, longitude: Geographical coordinates of the listings.
  5) room_type: Type of room (e.g., entire home, private room).
  6) price: Cost of the listing per night.
  7) Price per bed: Price divided by the number of beds.
  8) minimum_nights: Minimum nights required for booking.
  9) availability_365: Days available in a year for bookings.
  10) reviews (number, per month, last review): Insights into review counts and activity.
  11) rating: Guest ratings for the listing.
  12) bedrooms, beds, baths: Accommodation capacity and details.
  13) calculated_host_listings_count: Total number of active listings by the host.
  14) license: Regulatory compliance.

# Objectives
  Data Cleaning:
    A) Handle missing values in columns like reviews_per_month, license, etc.
    B) Standardize column formats for ease of analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    A) Examine price distributions and Price-per-bed trends.
    B) Explore location-based analysis (e.g., neighbourhood_group, latitude, longitude).
    C) Identify factors influencing room type preferences and guest ratings.
    D) Analyze relationships between price, minimum nights, and availability.

# Visualization Goals:

    A) Bar Charts: Popular room types and neighbourhood distribution.
    B) Heatmaps: Correlation between numerical variables (e.g., price, rating).
    C) Scatter Plots: Geographic analysis using latitude and longitude.

# Technologies Used
  Python: Main programming language.
  Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and computation.
  Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualization tools for detailed insights.
  Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis environment.
